# Notes
- maybe sort file paths in files_create?
- maybe ditch files_create and only use path_files_create
- flush stdout before printing hash
- rename args to paths in args
- rename alg to algorithm in args
- write done comments in file.h
- add space after 'if' 'for'... in file.h md5.h sha256.h
- rewrite makefile (simplify)
